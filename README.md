# FaaSNet

FaaSNet is a lightweight system middleware to mitigate unacceptable cold start latency for large-scale serverless container image provisioning.

This repo contains two components:

- Prototype of ```Function Tree``` of FaaSNet.
- FaaS cold start trace collected from [Alibaba Cloud Function Compute](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/function-compute).
